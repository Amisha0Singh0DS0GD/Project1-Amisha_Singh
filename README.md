Project Name - EDA on Public Code Review Sessions

# Expert vs. Beginner Coding Workflow Analysis

This project explores how coders approach problem-solving, debugging, and structuring their code in live coding sessions. The focus is on analyzing workflows rather than classifying coders.

## **Project Overview**

1. **Video Processing** – Extracting frames & text from coding sessions.
2. **Code Evolution** – Tracking changes in code over time.
3. **Keystroke & Debugging Patterns**– Measuring typing speed and debugging vs. writing time.
4. **Visualizations** – Presenting insights through data analysis.

## **Repository Contents**

- blog_post.pdf – Contains detailed methodology,analysis & findings.

- video_processing.ipynb – Contains code to extract frames from  video, preprocess the frames and the extraction 
                           of code from the frames.

- video_analysis.ipynb – Contains code for analysis and identifying pattern from the extracted result.

- metrics_visualization.ipynb – Contains code for visualization of the metrics obtained(specifically here I have the code for the metrics obtained for two videos of my dataset that I have presented in my blog).

- dataset – Sample dataset that contains data obtained after video processing.

Charts and graphs are included in the blog.
(All the codes were written on google colab downloaded as python notebook)
