Project Name - EDA on Public Code Review Sessions

# Expert vs. Beginner Coding Workflow Analysis

This project explores how coders approach problem-solving, debugging, and structuring their code in live coding sessions. The focus is on analyzing workflows rather than classifying coders.

## **Project Overview**

1. **Video Processing** – Extracting frames & text from coding sessions.
2. **Code Evolution** – Tracking changes in code over time.
3. **Keystroke & Debugging Patterns**– Measuring typing speed and debugging vs. writing time.
4. **Visualizations** – Presenting insights through data analysis.
